<h1>Project Overview</h1>
<p>
    This project is part of an Interaction Design course at UC San Diego, and the course centers around creating a UX/product <br>
    design case study. I worked in a team of 3 to extend a popular mobile app in a new way. Through this 10-week course, our <br>
    team learned and worked on disgn ideas, conducting & collecting user research, making prototypes, and narrowing design <br>
    choices to make a final product.
</p>

<h1>Background</h1>
<p>
    Whether it be with friends, family, or someone one just wants to know better, a meal together is a chance to connect. <br>
    This group was inspired by The Atlantic article, “The Importance of Eating Together” to extend a feature in the social <br>
    media app, Yelp to encourage friends in each other’s areas to get togeher in-person and physically interact in a <br>
    meaningful way through a meal. 
</p>
<p>
    The article inspires eating a meal together for two reasons: it is less expensive and more healthy to eat together, <br>
    and sharing a meal allows people to put aside work and focus on relationships. This group will add and extend a Yelp <br>
    messaging feature where people can share restaurants, decide on what to eat via poll, and make a reservation in-app. <br>
    This will allow friends to choose where to eat and make plans together with ease. 
</p>

<h1>User Research</h1>
<p>
    To start our design process, we needed to conduct user research to find out what users want from Yelp. Our team decided <br>
    to do surveys and personal interviews as our research methods. The surveys were mainly to get an overall sense of user <br>
    experience on Yelp. We included personal interviews to see the process of how people use Yelp to find a restaurant and <br>
    share that restaurant with friends. From our research findings, we narrowed in on two main problems users were facing <br>
    when using Yelp. First, users had trouble selecting a storefront in a timely manner. They also had inconsistent methods <br>
    for sharing Yelp results with their friends.
</p>

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
<p>
    Friends need a reliable, consistent way to coordinate restaurant choices and availability in order to efficiently <br>
    meet up and share a meal together.
</p>

<h1>User Personas</h1>
<p>Our team created different personas that would fit our Problem Statement. </p>

<p>
    Tim is a project manager at a tech company. He has been extremely overwhelmed with work lately that he feels like he doesn’t <br>
    have time to catch up with his friends through dinner. Finding a restaurant and coordinating with multiple people takes <br>
    too long and often takes the fun out of wanting to catch up with friends.
</p>

<p>
    Jared just moved to a new city for his first year of college and is having trouble coordinating plans with all the new <br>
    people he has met. He would like a trusted resource to assist in finding and deciding upon new places to visit in this <br>
    new city to ensure that he and his friends have a great time. 
</p>

<p>
    Vivian is an avid foodie. She loves using Yelp to find new, delicious restaurants to eat at and share that passion <br>
    with friends. However, she has noticed that there isn’t a reliable way to share a restaurant with friends and <br>
    coordinate with them besides messaging back and forth with different friends. She wants to be able to coordinate with <br>
    friends easily after finding a place to eat at.
</p>

<h1>UX Flows</h1>
<p>
    We created two different UX flows that was on separate platforms. One was completely done on Yelp app, and the UX <br>
    flow was a Yelp feature that is already built into Facebook Messenger app. 
</p>

<p>
    The entry point for this UX flow is the storefront page that is chosen by the user already. This is because our goal <br>
    here is to make it easier for the user to share a storefront that they want to send to friends. For this UX flow, <br>
    users can easily share the storefront they found to group chats in Messenger and from there, they can make a <br>
    reservation. After making the reservation, the whole group can see the date/time, and then they can choose to add <br>
    that to their calendar or check the directions to the storefront. These functions help consolidate all the information <br>
    needed into one area, and the user can easily access it on Messenger.
</p>

<p>
    The entry point for this UX flow is opening the Yelp app. This is because our goal here is to start and finish within <br>
    the Yelp app, and have all the group functions done in the app. For this UX flow, users can create a group and add <br>
    people that they wish to eat together with. Then, they can find a restaurant and add it to a poll that the group can <br>
    see. Friends can also do the same, and everyone can vote on different restaurant choices. When finished, the restaurant <br>
    with the most votes is chosen, and everyone can see the result in the group.
</p>

<h1>UI Sketches</h1>
<p>
    Our team came up with the following UI sketches based on the UX flow where Yelp is an added feature on Facebook Messenger.
</p>

<h1>Prototyping</h1>

<h2>Paper Prototypes</h2>
<p>
    With the paper prototypes, we decided upon two very different UX flows to test and determine which prototype users would <br>
    find more efficient and functional. Prototype A accesses Yelp’s search engine and storefront information within the <br>
    iMessage application. Yelp already has a plugin for iMessage to search for storefronts so we simply decided to utilize <br>
    this plugin to extend and add our new feature for users to test. For Prototype B we decided to create a UX flow that <br>
    stays contained within the Yelp application. For each of these prototypes, we decided upon different tasks for the <br>
    users to perform. Therefore, in addition to figuring out which UX flow users preferred, we could also acquire more <br>
    information regarding which feature would be more useful for users. 
</p>

<h2>User Testing</h2>
<p>
    For user testing based on the paper prototypes, we spoke to three different people in the COGS 127 class that uses <br>
    Yelp on a regular basis to search for restaurants and read reviews. 
    <h3>Prototype A</h3>
    <p>
        Users enjoyed the easy reservation option and mused that the design was similar to Yelp and Messenger but remained <br>
        equally sleek and simple. However, users were confused on whether the Yelp message cards when sharing a certain restaurant <br>
        were clickable or simple, static messages and also weren’t quite sure how the sharing in the new iPhone OS worked.
    </p>
    <h3>Prototype B</h3>
    <p>
        Users felt that the UI overall was intuitive and polling with friends was useful. The user wished they had the polls <br>
        function in the Flow #1. However, users were confused on whether every person in the group chat was required to vote before <br>
        closing a poll and who could close the poll.
    </p>

    <p>
        Based on this feedback, Group 1 interprets that we were able to successfully design and bridge the two most wanted features <br>
        users were interested in from initial user research and overall make the user flow intuitive. The only caveat was minor <br>
        design specifications and buttons being slightly unclear or requiring more user thinking about what they actually have to <br>
        click next. 
    </p>
</p>

<h2>High-Fidelity Prototypes</h2>
<p>
    Our high-fidelity prototype is based on one of the original UX flows from A2, but we also changed it slightly to account <br>
    for the user testing feedback we received. Our UX flow idea is the same, but we adjusted some buttons and layout of the <br>
    UI to be more intuitive. People were confused about the “Vote” button next to the “Close Poll” button since they didn’t <br>
    know should press it after submitting their vote. We added a screen where there is confirmation that users have submitted <br>
    their votes and ask them if they want to close the poll. This helps inform users that there is an option to close the poll <br>
    after voting.

    For the transition from our low-fidelity prototype to this high-fidelity prototype, we stayed consistent with the low-fidelity<br>
    UX and UI design and simply translated the black and white sketches into Yelp icons and style using their styleguide. While <br>
    there were some small tweaks based off our user testing, the overall layout of each screen stayed constant, in terms of <br>
    ontent placement and UX flow. This consistency definitely made the creation of the high-fidelity prototype much smoother, <br>
    as all three of us were on the same page and could quickly figure out what needed to be included on each screen and <br>
    cross-reference with the low-fidelity prototype to make sure all the important information was present in the high-fidelity screens. 
        
    The biggest issue that we came across when creating this high-fidelity prototype revolved around which content to include for <br>
    some of smaller display boxes. The exact wording and text was not included in the low-fidelity prototype so we were tasked to <br>
    brainstorm and solve which information would be the most useful when space is limited. 
        
    Overall, without user testing we, mostly likely, would not have identified the usability issues with our original design and <br>
    our high-fidelity prototype would look identical to our low-fidelity design. Especially because the issues that were brought <br>
    to our attention were small-scale (like having an extra button) and would be almost impossible to identify without the help <br>
    of a fresh set of eyes that had not seen the prototype before.
