    Whether it be with friends, family, or someone one just wants to know better, a meal together is a chance to connect. 
    This group was inspired by The Atlantic article, “The Importance of Eating Together” to extend a feature in the social media app, 
    Yelp to encourage friends in each other’s areas to get togeher in-person and physically interact in a meaningful way through a meal. 
</p>
<p>
    The article inspires eating a meal together for two reasons: it is less expensive and more healthy to eat together, 
    and sharing a meal allows people to put aside work and focus on relationships. This group will create a Facebook Messenger Yelp extension
     to share restaurants, decide on what to eat via poll, and make a reservation in-app which will allow friends to choose where to eat and make plans together with ease.
